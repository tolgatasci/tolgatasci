### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Tolga Tasci - 33 :crab: - Turkey :tr:

I share publicly everything I do. If I didn't do it for someone else. To make me a better quality sharer;
- Follow me :heavy_plus_sign:
- Star the repositories you use or can use. âœ¨
- Suggest me something. :envelope:
- Suggest the mistakes I made or the skills I need to improve. :pencil2:

How am I now:
- I am a 1st year remote university student ðŸŽ’
- I'm developing my english. :us:
- I'm looking for a job. ðŸ”Ž


Note : Swimming :swimming_man: and watching movies are my indispensable activities.
